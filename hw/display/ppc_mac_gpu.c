/*
 * PPC Mac GPU - ATI Radeon 9200 (RV280) compatible display device for QEMU
 *
 * Emulates enough of the RV280 register interface for Mac OS X Tiger/Leopard
 * ATI kext attachment and accelerated framebuffer operation on PowerMac G4.
 *
 * Strategy: Radeon compatibility path. We present PCI IDs that match the
 * Radeon 9200 PRO (RV280), which Tiger's ATIRadeon9700.kext will recognize
 * and attach to. We emulate only the registers the driver actually touches.
 *
 * Host targets: Intel macOS + Apple Silicon macOS (both via Metal or SW).
 * Guest targets: Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.11 PPC, Leopard 10.5 PPC.
 *
 * This file contains the PCI device model, MMIO register handlers,
 * VRAM management, CRTC mode tracking, interrupt generation, and
 * display surface hookup. All code is pure C with no platform dependencies.

 * Draws on a worker thread.
 * ------------------------
 * A host sample put 16.7% of the vCPU thread in this device model, with the
 * draw path the largest named function in the whole profile -- while the
 * machine around it sat with most of its cores idle. The emulator is one
 * thread per guest CPU and the guest has one CPU, so the only way to use
 * those cores is to take work out of that thread.
 *
 * What makes it safe is a contract the guest already keeps. Real hardware
 * reads vertex memory asynchronously, so a driver must not reuse a buffer
 * until a fence says the GPU is done with it -- and this device already
 * implements those fences. Reading guest memory from a worker is therefore
 * not a new hazard; it is the hazard the interface was designed around.
 *
 * What is *not* safe is reading registers, because the guest keeps writing
 * them while the worker runs. Each job therefore carries a snapshot. The
 * copy is the whole device state by value: the fields a draw reads besides
 * the registers are three pointers and a size, and copying them along with
 * the registers is cheaper than auditing which ones a future change might
 * add.
 *
 * Ordering rides on r200_flush_at(), which everything that needs to see
 * finished drawing already calls. Draining there keeps 2D blits, scanout,
 * fences and register reads in the order the guest asked for, without any
 * new ordering rules to get wrong.
 *
 * Off by default: PPCGPU_ASYNC_DRAW=1 turns it on. A threading fault in a
 * device model is the kind that corrupts rarely rather than failing
 * cleanly, so this does not become the default until it has been measured
 * and lived with.

 * screen, piece by piece, every time anything changes.  A window therefore
 * shows up as a run of copies that share a source surface, and its frame is
 * the rectangle those copies cover.
 *
 * This watches those copies and keeps a list.  It is only a reader: nothing
 * here changes what is drawn.  PPCGPU_WINDOWS=1 turns it on, and the list
 * is printed whenever it settles.
 *
 * A window is redrawn in bursts: a run of copies close together, then
 * nothing until something changes again.  The frame is the rectangle one
 * burst covers, and each new burst starts a new rectangle -- otherwise a
 * window that moves reports the union of everywhere it has ever been,
 * which is no use to anything that wants to draw it.
 *
 * Known limits, measured on 10.4 and 10.5 alike: a surface is sometimes
 * reused for more than one window (the same address turns up with two
 * different scanline lengths), so a surface is not an identity.  Grouping
 * by surface *and* scanline length is closer, and the guest agent will have
 * to supply the real identity in the end.
